Project Name: 

Car Maintenance Tracker 

Description, Purpose, and Value: 

The Car Maintenance Tracker is a web application designed to help vehicle owners manage and track essential aspects of car care. It enables users to log and monitor their vehicle's maintenance history, including details about service types, costs, and dates. The platform also allows users to record fuel consumption, track mileage, and set reminders for car washes based on usage intervals. By providing detailed reports on maintenance expenses, fuel costs, and fuel efficiency, the application offers valuable insights that help users make informed decisions about vehicle maintenance and budgeting. The app aims to simplify car maintenance tasks, ensuring that users stay on top of their vehicleâ€™s needs and optimize their overall vehicle management. 

Technologies Used: 

The application is built with Flask, a micro web framework, and utilizes Flask-SQLAlchemy for database interaction. Flask-Login is used for managing user authentication and sessions. The frontend is developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, while the database is powered by SQLite, a lightweight, serverless database. The app also leverages Werkzeug for secure password hashing and Jinja2 for dynamic HTML rendering. For exporting service history, the app provides a CSV download functionality.
